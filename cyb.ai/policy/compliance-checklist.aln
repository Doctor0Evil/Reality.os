// Reality.os / CYB.ai Clinical & Technical Compliance Checklist
// Version: 2025.11.06 | Adapted for BCI, Neurotech, Neuromorphic, Cybernano, Isomorphic-Hardware

CHECKLIST ClinicalAndTechnicalCompliance {
  LEGAL_COMPLIANCE {
    - Verify MDR, FDA (or relevant), GDPR, HIPAA, and AI Act conformity
    - Document multi-factor user consent and neuro-rights artifact (.aln)
    - Log device provenance, chain-of-trust, operator identities
    - Validate cross-border data movement, encryption, and anonymization
  }

  HARDWARE/TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE {
    - Identify all critical hardware specs: processor, neuron/synapse count, memory, interfaces
    - Run onboard diagnostics and integrity checks for neuromorphic/BCI modules
    - Produce .aln hardware audit log and artifact for regulatory records
    - Validate biometric, quantum, device-bound key management is active
    - Ensure anti-tamper, isolation, and non-invasive fallback protocols

  SOFTWARE/NETWORK COMPLIANCE:
    - Confirm firmware version, AI/ML modules, device drivers
    - Test distributed artifact generation and immutable logs
    - Validate integration and compatibility with CYB.ai ecosystem (runtime, network)
    - Audit remote telemetry and biosensor feedback for privacy and safety compliance

  CLINICAL SAFETY:
    - Check biosensor calibration and signal range (blood, protein, metabolic)
    - Validate emergency shutdown and adaptive power throttling modules
    - Verify clinical trial/approval workflow; audit device events on multi-quorum ledger
    - Perform user safety and feedback review with council-annotated artifact
