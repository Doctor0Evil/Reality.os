POLICY IntegratedAugmentedEcosystem {
    PURPOSE: "Establish unified compliance, technical, and economic rules enabling deployment, safety, and viability of nanoswarm, neuromorphic, and blockchain-enabled income tools for augmented users."

    SECTION NanoswarmVsNanobot {
        RULE nanoswarm_design:   "Swarm intelligence; large collectives; emergent behavior; redundancy and distributed action."
        RULE nanobot_design:     "Individually engineered, localized, high-precision logic."
        MANDATE control_audit:   "All system logs, failures, and behavior to be recorded for review/audit and swarm-level compliance."
        REQUIREMENT traceability: "Each swarm unit must be cryptographically tagged with a unique, non-reversible ID traceable to deployment origin and user consent log."
        PROHIBIT autonomous_mutation: "No swarm unit may self-modify its core behavioral algorithm without explicit, real-time, multi-factor user consent and regulatory override."
    }

    SECTION NeuromorphicEnergyStrategy {
        RULE enable_low_cost:         "Mandate use of energy-harvesting, supercapacitor, and biofuel modules wherever technically feasible."
        ENFORCE adaptive_firmware:    "All firmware must enable adaptive scaling based on user biosignals and energy load (e.g., neural idle state, metabolic rate, motion profile)."
        REQUIRE biocompat:            "Modules must pass ISO/IEC 10993-5 (cytotoxicity), ISO/IEC 60601-1 (medical electrical safety), and IEC 62366-1 (usability engineering) for wearable/implant use."
        REQUIRE thermal_stability:    "No module may exceed 38.5°C surface temperature under maximum operational load in vivo or on-skin."
        REQUIRE redundancy:           "Critical neuromorphic subsystems must deploy distributed redundancy modules (≥3 nodes) with failover consensus protocols."
    }

    SECTION PassiveIncomeContracts {
        ALLOW compute_leasing:      "Idle neuromorphic resources may participate in secure distributed compute networks for direct reward."
        ALLOW data_marketplace:     "User-consented, anonymized biosignal data may be shared via blockchain markets for micro-incentives."
        ALLOW energy_trading:       "Excess harvested energy may be tokenized and shared in mesh or smart network pools."
        ENSURE privacy_compliance:  "All economic activity adheres to data consent protocols, GDPR/CCPA alignment, and logs transaction artifacts in blockchain-compatible ledger."
        MANDATE consent_layer:      "Each data or compute lease must be preceded by a dynamic, context-aware consent prompt (visual/auditory/neural) and require re-confirmation if user state changes (e.g., sleep, seizure, cognitive load)."
        PROHIBIT coercion:          "No incentive structure may be designed to exploit physiological vulnerability (e.g., pain, fatigue, anxiety) to induce consent."
    }

    SECTION UniversalCompliance {
        LOG_EVENT on_deployment:      "Every system deployment, module update, and economic transaction recorded in immutable ALN artifact."
        ENFORCE rollback_protocols:   "Detect, halt, and roll back non-compliant or safety-risk events automatically within 200ms using embedded edge AI watchdog."
        ENABLE audit_dashboard:       "Auto-generate summaries, compliance matrices, and event chains for regulator and developer review."
        REQUIRE blockchain_anchor:    "All ALN artifacts must be anchored to a public, permissionless ledger (e.g., Bitcoin Layer 2 or Ethereum L2) with timestamped Merkle root proof."
        REQUIRE transparence:         "All compliance logs must be accessible to the user in real-time via a personal compliance portal with granular permission controls."
    }
