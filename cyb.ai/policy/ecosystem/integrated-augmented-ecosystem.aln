POLICY IntegratedAugmentedEcosystem {
    PURPOSE: "Establish unified compliance, technical, and economic rules enabling deployment, safety, and viability of nanoswarm, neuromorphic, and blockchain-enabled income tools for augmented users."

    SECTION NanoswarmVsNanobot {
        RULE nanoswarm_design:   "Swarm intelligence; large collectives; emergent behavior; redundancy and distributed action."
        RULE nanobot_design:     "Individually engineered, localized, high-precision logic."
        MANDATE control_audit:   "All system logs, failures, and behavior to be recorded for review/audit and swarm-level compliance."
    }

    SECTION NeuromorphicEnergyStrategy {
        RULE enable_low_cost:         "Mandate use of energy-harvesting, supercapacitor, and biofuel modules wherever technically feasible."
        ENFORCE adaptive_firmware:    "All firmware must enable adaptive scaling based on user biosignals and energy load."
        REQUIRE biocompat:            "Modules must pass ISO/IEC biocompatibility and electrical safety for wearable/implant use."
    }

    SECTION PassiveIncomeContracts {
        ALLOW compute_leasing:      "Idle neuromorphic resources may participate in secure distributed compute networks for direct reward."
        ALLOW data_marketplace:     "User-consented, anonymized biosignal data may be shared via blockchain markets for micro-incentives."
        ALLOW energy_trading:       "Excess harvested energy may be tokenized and shared in mesh or smart network pools."
        ENSURE privacy_compliance:  "All economic activity adheres to data consent protocols, GDPR/CCPA alignment, and logs transaction artifacts in blockchain-compatible ledger."
    }

    SECTION UniversalCompliance {
        LOG_EVENT on_deployment:      "Every system deployment, module update, and economic transaction recorded in immutable ALN artifact."
        ENFORCE rollback_protocols:   "Detect, halt, and roll back non-compliant or safety-risk events automatically."
        ENABLE audit_dashboard:       "Auto-generate summaries, compliance matrices, and event chains for regulator and developer review."
    }

    // Auto-produce .aln artifacts per deployment, integration, and income action across all supported modules
