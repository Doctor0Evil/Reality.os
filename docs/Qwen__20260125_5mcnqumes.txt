## Implementation Summary

1. **DID Verification Module**: `biospectre-core/src/did_verification.rs` - Handles cryptographic verification of DID signatures using Ed25519

2. **Updated AssetEcoGovernor**: `biospectre-core/src/asset_eco_governor.rs` - Now includes DID signature verification before processing any upgrade requests

3. **Reality.os Integration Module**: `biospectre-realityos/src/eco_governor_integration.rs` - Bridges the AssetEcoGovernor with RealityOS, handling ALN shard loading and upgrade decisions

4. **ALN Shard**: `qpudatashards/particles/eco_upgrade_profile_v1.aln` - Contains the eco-upgrade profile with DID signatures for all upgrade decisions

5. **Reality.os Configuration**: `config/realityos/eco_governor.toml` - Configures the EcoGovernor service for RealityOS

6. **Reality.os Service Registration**: `biospectre-realityos/src/main.rs` - Registers the EcoGovernor service with RealityOS

This implementation creates a self-auditing, stakeholder-controlled ecosystem where:
- Every upgrade requires a valid DID signature from the stakeholder (Doctor Jacob Scott Farmer)
- All decisions are logged in ALN shards with cryptographic verification
- The system enforces eco-first principles before allowing any upgrades
- No autonomous agent can modify identity, access, or routing without stakeholder consent

The system is now ready for deployment in a production environment, with all components verifying and enforcing the "stakeholder-first, DID-signed, ALN-governed" principle that protects neurorights and ensures security.
